# Evaluating Memory Management Algorithms

As we will learn in this course, the way in which free parts of a
divisible resource like memory is managed can have a significant
effect on how efficiently it is used.

We will examine this using a memory management experiment.  You are
to write a C program to implement the memory management scheme
described below, and submit both the code and an analysis of your
code based on the testing as described in this assignment.

A starter program consisting of a `main()` function is provided for
you.  This is provided so that the command-line for all of the
assignments is consistent, to assist in marking.  Be sure to use this
code as the starting point for in your work.

In addition there are a number of example programs available in the
CIS\*3110/Operating Systems course directory (`/home/courses/cis3110`).
You may find the "`memdbg_map.c`" tool useful as described below.

As with the use of any third-party resource in your academic writing,
you must note the use of this (or any other) code in the writeup
of your assignment, in order to avoid plagiarism (representing the
work of another as your own).

Citing program code is always somewhat more confusing than citing
a book or paper, but the same principles apply: indicate the author,
the date, the name of the entity being cited, and the source.

For the the `memdbg_map` code in the course directory, this would be:

* author: Hamilton-Wright, Andrew
* name: Memory map block inspection
* year: 2011
* source: Operating Systems Course Directory, School of Computer Science,
	University of Guleph

You can format these in a reference document or comment as you wish,
however it is best to follow an established standard (e.g. APA format
for bibliographies.)


# Memory allocation in C

In general, memory allocation in C works by having access to a large
block of memory (a set of consecutive bytes), and giving back a
portion of that block, identified by a starting address and a size.

On a virtual memory system we generally have access to a dynamically
growing heap while in embedded systems (IoT devices, cars, *etc*) there
is a fixed total memory block available, and all allocations have to
come from that block.

Each allocation is satisfied by "carving out" an unassigned portion
of the fixed block.  You can envision this as much like cutting slices
off of a loaf (of bread, cheese, etc.) to satisfy various requests.

Memory is, of course, constrained in size -- that is, the total
available block of memory can be envisioned as a fixed size (we
will talk about the finer points of this in class, but for now,
assume that there is one fixed size block).  This means that one
cannot keep carving off new allocations forever, as memory would
run out.

The good news is, that while current programming styles demand
hundreds, or even thousands, of allocations, they generally do not
require use of each allocation forever.  Put another way, allocation
are requested, and then a short time later, released, or given back.
This implies that an allocation can be used again to satisfy another
request after it has been released by the client program.

You are already familiar with the allocation and release functions
in C -- these are `malloc()` and `free()`.  In C++ these are performed
using the keywords `new` and `delete`.  The Java language hides the
release operation from the user, so the releases occur within the
garbage collector, but they still occur.

The bad news is that programs usually don't give back the memory
in anything like the same order it was allocated.  If memory releases
happened in the same (or reverse) order of allocation, we would
simply need to maintain a queue (or stack) to figure out how to put
the pieces back together.  Instead, we need a data structure that
can be edited in the middle, as well as at both ends -- frequently,
this is implemented as a linked list.

If one simply uses a list (linked or otherwise) to keep track of
"allocated" and "free" chunks of the block, then the `free()` function
would mean changing the state of one of the chunks from "allocated" to
"free".  Any "free" chunk of a large enough size could then be given
out again later, and changed to "allocated".

The first tricky bit is that the overhead for your list should come
out of the chunk also.  If you have a "next" pointer as part of your
chunk management, for instance, then the memory for the next pointer
should come out of the chunk allocation, so you will have to add on
the extra overhead for this management to the size requested.

Another tricky bit is the size.  Inconveniently for us, programs also
usually don't ask for exactly the same size pieces again, so the
question arises: how does one satisfy a request, knowing that there
will likely not be a chunk of exactly the right size?  Determining
what happens for different answers to this question is the intent
of this assignment.

A final wrinkle is that if there are two "free" chunks that are
side-by-side (i.e.; contiguous in memory), then we really want to
consider this to be one "free" chunk the size of both of these,
merged together.  This is a tricky bit of programming, so this
assignment is structured to let you pursue most of the marks before
you even attempt adding merging to your code.

Assume that when you start that there is one chunk, and that it
fills the whole available memory region -- your code will then
carve it up from there.

# Allocation Chunk Discovery Strategies

We will explore what happens if we use the following strategies to
determine which chunk to use for a given allocation:

* **first**: this strategy uses the first chunk allocated that
		is free, and has a size equal to or greater than the requested
		size.  If it is larger than the requested size, it is split
		in two, and the remaining portion remains as a free chunk
		that may be allocated later
* **best**: this strategy finds the chunk that will produce the
		least waste (minimizing the number of additional bytes
		beyond those that are required).  As in "first", any additional
		bytes are split off, and treated as unallocated
* **worst**: similar to best, but maximizing, not minimizing. additional
		bytes

We will discuss the theory behind these algorithms in class in a few
weeks, but this assignment will let you gather some empirical data
yourselves (putting the "Science" in Computer Science).


# Programming Task

Copy the starter code from the course directory into the location
where you plan to work:

```
cp -r /home/courses/cis3110/assignments/CIS3110-W25-A1-code .
```

For this assignment, you are to write a C program (using the `main()`
supplied in `allocator_main.c`) that will take a series of allocations
and releases provided in a file, and print out whether each allocation
can be satisfied.  At the end of the run, a summary should be printed
indicating how many bytes are allocated, how many bytes are free,
and a list of each "chunk" and its state (free or allocated).
The summary should be preceded by the word "`SUMMARY`" and should
then have the format shown in the example
(bytes allocated, bytes free, and then a list of all of the chunks).

## Input Data Format

Parsing code has been supplied for you to read files of allocations
and deallocations.

### Allocations

Allocation lines will begin with the letter `A`, and then have an
*ID*, a *size* and an optional "paint character" indicated separated
by colons (`:`).  Sizes can be given in hexadecimal or in decimal.
Spacing is ignored.  Examples:
	
* `A:11:1231`
* `A:12:0x0200:+`

In the first case, when the paint character is not given, a default
value of "`~`" is used.

It is an error to re-use the same ID for more than one allocations.
You can assume that our testing files will not do this.

### Deallocations

Deallocation lines will begin with the letter `F` for "free" or
(`R`, for "release"), and then have an *ID*.  No size is required,
as the *ID* should let you locate the allocation.
Spacing is again ignored.  Examples:
	
* `F:1`
* `R:2`

It is an error (of course) to attempt to deallocate the same ID more
than once.

You must however handle a request to deallocate an ID that is not
there -- this may simply refer to an allocation request that could
not be honoured because memory ran out.  If your code encounters
this is is fine to report it at the time, but do not stop processing.

## Sample Run
A sample run of the program might look like this:

```
$ ./allocator -m 4096 -s first smalltest.txt
alloc 1024 bytes : SUCCESS - return location 0
alloc 2048 bytes : SUCCESS - return location 1024
alloc 2048 bytes : FAIL
alloc 512 bytes : SUCCESS - return location 3072
free location 1024
free location 0
alloc 4096 bytes : FAIL
alloc 3000 bytes : SUCCESS - return location 0
SUMMARY:
3512 bytes allocated
584 bytes free
4 allocation chunks:
chunk  0 location    0:3000 bytes - allocated
chunk  1 location 3000:72 bytes - free
chunk  2 location 3072:512 bytes - allocated
chunk  3 location 3584:512 bytes - free
```

An astute reader will note that the memory taken up by any
indexing required to track the chunks (i.e.; the linked list
or other structure) has not been included in this.  Again,
this makes things trickier, and so assignments are accepted
without adding this additional code (see marking scheme below).

## Debugging Tool

A "memory dump" utility has been provided for you in the course
directory.  This is called "`memdbg_map.c`" and it prints out a specified
region of memory in the same format that `hexdump(1)` uses when run with
the `-C` option..
(That is, it prints the requested block of memory, 16 bytes per output
line -- first printing the values in hexadecimal, and then printing
the same values as ASCII characters if printable, and as a '`.`' if
not printable.)

If you want to print 192 bytes to standard output starting from the
address stored in the variable `my_allocation`, and indent each line
by three spaces (to set it off from the rest of your program output)
then you could call it like this:

```
memdbg_dump_map(stdout, NULL, my_allocation, 192, 3);
```

Passing NULL here will provide the absolute memory addresses along
the left margin.  If you instead want to see the offsets relative
to the `my_allocation` pointer, then simply use this form instead:

```
memdbg_dump_map(stdout, NULL, my_allocation, 192, 3);
```

### Note on Memory Access

Note that all the regular rules apply about memory access -- in
particular, if you provide a large number as the `nBytesToPrint`
value and this causes the dump tool to run past the end of allocated
memory, then you will get a SEGV program crash.  (There is nothing
special that would allow this code to access memory that would
otherwise be invalid.)


# Deliverables

You will hand this assignment in electronically, in a single
`.zip` or `.tar` file, using CourseLink.  This file should
contain:


1) all `.c` and `.h` files required to build your assignment
2) a `makefile` that will build your assignment when the command
	"`make`" is issued
3) an `OUTCOMES.md` file indicating which parts of the assignment is
	successfully completed, and what experiments were performed,
	in order to answer the following questions (based on your
	implementation and findings).

Include the "SUMMARY" information for at least two runs
based on allocations of your own devising, and include
these allocation files in your submission.

Use your code to answer these questions:

* which algorithm manages memory in the least overall number of chunks? 
* which algorithm manages memory with the greatest number of
  successful allocations?

This file should be in either ASCII or UTF-8 text "markdown" format.


# Marking Scheme

The following outlines the mark breakdown:

* Basic coding of a program that does allocations and reports
	them as described (35%)
* Merging adjacent free allocations upon release (15%)
* Managing indexing within the allocation block (20%)
* Creating experiments to explore different allocation patterns (15%)
* Final report, explaining your code and your findings (15%)


# Suggested Approach

A good first step would be to get the basic program working, without
trying to manage the the indexing within the allocation blocks, and
without merging.

At that point, you can run experiments.  If you then wish to tackle
merging, or internal management, first **save your code**
as is, and then work on the additional functionality.  You can update
your experimentation based on your new code, or you can (with a clear
explanation) submit the report on an earlier version of your code,
and include a more full featured version.

If you like, you can even **hand in an early working version** and then
later update that in CourseLink.  We will simply mark whatever is the
last version submitted before the assignment deadline.


# Submitting your Assignment

Use `tar(1)` to bundle up your code, makefile OUTCOMES.md file and your
test run files.  See the `make tar` rule in the supplied makefile
for this -- please modify if it does not capture all of your files.

Before submitting, **UNPACK** your archive in a new directory to make
sure that you are in fact submitting everything you want to submit,
and that everything works.  If your code doesn't build based on what
you submit, there will not be a chance to resubmit for this foolish
error.
